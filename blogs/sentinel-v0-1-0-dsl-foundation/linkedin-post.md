🛡️ **Sentinel v0.1.0 is live: The foundation for "Postman for AI Agents"**

After weeks of building in public with Claude Code, I'm excited to share the first release of Sentinel—a visual-first agent testing platform for AI labs and teams.

**What we shipped today:**

✅ Type-safe DSL with Pydantic schema
✅ Round-trip YAML/JSON parsing (zero data loss)
✅ 8 assertion types for comprehensive testing
✅ 6 production-ready templates
✅ 70 tests, 98% coverage
✅ Complete documentation (5,000+ lines)

**Why it matters:**

Testing AI agents today is painful. You either:
• Write custom scripts for every test
• Use frameworks that feel like homework
• Manually test by running agents over and over

We're building something better.

**The vision: "Point, Click, Test"**

Imagine testing AI agents like you test APIs in Postman:
🎨 Drag-and-drop visual canvas
📝 Real-time YAML generation
🔄 Round-trip sync (Visual ↔ Code)
📊 Visual regression comparison
🚀 One-click execution with live metrics

**v0.1.0 is the foundation.** The visual canvas comes in v0.2.0 (Q1 2026).

**Who's it for?**

🎯 Product Managers testing agents without code
🧪 QA Engineers building visual test suites
🔬 Research Scientists building evals
🛡️ Safety Teams testing edge cases
🏢 Frontier Labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) regression testing models
🚀 Neo-labs building agent products

**Behind the scenes:**

This entire project was built using **vibe coding with Claude Code**. Some unique learnings:

• Test-driven development with AI (write tests first, AI implements)
• Let AI write docs while writing code (catches design issues early)
• CLAUDE.md as source of truth (provides context for every interaction)
• Incremental releases (ship small, ship often)

I wrote a detailed blog post sharing:
✨ Deep dive into the DSL design
