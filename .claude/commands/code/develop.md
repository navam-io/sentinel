Think harder to complete these tasks:
1. Read backlog/active.md
2. Understand the current state of the project
3. Identify the next feature to implement
4. Develop the feature
5. Create tests for the feature ensuring these are testing feature in production and not faking it
6. Run all tests and fix any regressions
7. Determine semver increment (major, minor, patch) based on feature size. Increment the semver for the project.
8. When done, mark the feature complete and move it to respective backlog/release-semver.md file based on current release semver.
