Think harder to complete these tasks:
1. Read backlog/issues.md
2. Understand the current state of the project
3. Identify the next issue to resolve
4. Resolve the issue
5. Create tests for the issue ensuring these are testing issue in production and not faking it
6. Run all tests and fix any regressions
7. Determine semver increment (major, minor, patch) based on issue size. Increment the semver for the project.
8. When done, mark the issue complete and move it to respective backlog/release-semver.md file based on current release semver.
